# MindAid - AI-Powered Mental Health Platform

> **üß† AI-powered mental health diagnosis and counseling platform built with FastAPI, BERT, and LangChain**

## Inspiration


The inspiration for <ins>**MindAid**</ins> comes from our experiences living in small cities, where access to good counsellors, psychiatrist and mental health support is often limited or nonexistent. Despite the growing awareness and recognition of mental health issues globally, millions of people still face significant barriers to accessing the care they need due to stigma, lack of resources, geographic limitations, and financial constraints.
Moreover, many people hesitate to visit doctors due to fear, further widening the gap between those in need and the support they require. This deeply concerns us, and we believe technology can offer a solution.
MindAid was conceived out of a deep concern for these challenges and a strong belief in the transformative potential of technology. We recognized that artificial intelligence could play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between those in need and the mental health support they require. Our aim is to create a platform that can provide immediate, accessible, and reliable mental health assistance to anyone, anywhere, regardless of their circumstances.
By addressing the shortcomings of traditional mental health care, MindAid aspires to contribute to a world where mental health support is not a privilege, but a readily available resource for all.
Our mission is to empower individuals to take control of their mental health, break down the stigma associated with mental health issues, and promote a culture of understanding and support.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manas-7854/MediHacks.git
   cd MediHacks
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync

   # Or using pip
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Generate secret key**
   ```bash
   uv run python generate_secret.py
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Using the provided script
   ./run_uv.sh

   # Or manually
   uv run uvicorn src.mindaid.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Main App: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### AI Models

1. **Diagnosis Model**: `SiddharthShukla48/MindAid_Diagnosis_bert-base-multilingual-cased`
   - We employed the Google`s BERT-base-multilingual-cased model from Hugging Face, fine-tuning it to predict various mental health disorders. The dataset used for fine-tuning was sourced from Zenodo, providing a robust foundation for accurate diagnostics. We also used clinically authorized questionnaire to measure the severity of disorder.

2. **Counseling Model**: LLaMA 3 (70B) via Groq API
   - For the AI-powered counselor, we used LLaMA3-70B-8192 via Groq. To enhance the quality of counseling responses, we applied Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, which allows the model to generate more informed and contextually relevant responses.
